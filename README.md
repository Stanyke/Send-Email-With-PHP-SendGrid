Well break things down for begineers who don't know what SendGrid

	SendGrid is a Partner with the email service trusted by developers and marketers for time-savings, scalability, and delivery expertise.
	Which means that you can be able to send out your email without any daily, more importantly the mail arrives direct to the Inbox most times thou i've not seen it entered a spam folder before when using it with PHP or Ruby On Rails.
	
	The amazing thing about SendGrid is that its easy to use with their API and it's Freemium to use at first but has a limit and it also has Premium Plan 
	
	Also this project shows you how you can easily use it without composer, because most developer find it extremely difficult to use PHP composer, and here is a wonderful alternative.
	
Well Let's get down to business and don't get bored.
	Below are the steps to take to make sure your mail delivers as soon as possible becaus i really recommend SendGrid.

1.	Visit https://sendgrid.com and create an account with them, if you already have an account with them also gotten your API Key, you can skip to the 4th step, else continue reading.

2.	Now you have an account with SendGrid, go to "Settings" and look for "API Keys" and enter.

3.	Create a new API Key and make sure you save it somewhere because SendGrid only shows the Key just ones as you created the Key for security purposes.

4.	Now you can either clone this project or view and write yours but i recommend you cloning it because of the files in the folder "sendgrid-php" which will help push out the mails without composer.

5.	Place the PHP code (the one you have written, NB: mine is saved with mail.php) with the folder "sendgrid-php" in the same folder and run your code.


Yay! It worked, Happy Coding!!!
